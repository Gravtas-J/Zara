## Load NLP Model
Load a spaCy NLP model with word vectors for English.

## Set Streamlit Page Configuration
Configure the Streamlit page to have a wide layout.

## Define Utility Functions
- `append_date_time_to_chatlog()`: Appends the current date and time to a chatlog file.
- `ensure_userprofile_exists(filepath)`: Ensures a user profile file exists; creates the file and its directory if they don't.
- `ensure_Journal_exists(filepath)`: Similar to ensure_userprofile_exists, but for a journal file.
- `open_file(filepath)`: Opens and reads a file, returning its content.
- `chatbotGPT4(conversation, model, temperature, max_tokens)`: Generates a response from GPT-4 for a given conversation.
- `chatbotGPT3(conversation, model, temperature, max_tokens)`: Similar to chatbotGPT4, but uses GPT-3.5.
- `response_generator(msg_content)`: Generates a response word by word with a delay.
- `append_to_chatlog(message)`: Appends a message to the chatlog file.
- `fetch_journal_entries()`: Fetches journal entries from a SQLite database.
- `calculate_similarity(user_prompt, entries)`: Calculates similarity between a user prompt and journal entries using spaCy.

## Initialize Environment and Variables
- Load environmental variables.
- Ensure necessary files and directories exist.
- Load the OpenAI API key.
- Initialize variables for file paths.

## Initialize OpenAI Client
Instantiate the OpenAI client for API interactions.

## Streamlit Chat Input
Capture user input through Streamlit's chat input feature.

## Read and Process Files
Open and read content from various files for user updates, persona, and user profiles.

## Database Preparation
- Ensure the SQLite database for storing journal entries exists and is initialized.
- Parse and insert journal entries from a file into the database.

## Timestamp and Chatlog Initialization
Append the current date and time to the chatlog and initialize session states for managing timestamps, messages, and chat logs.

## Chatbot Interaction
- If there's user input, fetch journal entries, calculate similarity with the user's prompt, and prepare messages for the OpenAI API call.
- Generate and display the response using the assistant's avatar and update the session state with the conversation history.
- Update the user profile based on the conversation history using GPT-4.
- Append the latest conversation to the chatlog file.
