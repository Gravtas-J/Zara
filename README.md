# Project Title

## Description

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages OpenAI's GPT models for various functionalities, including chatbots, journaling, and document embedding. It incorporates a dynamic chat interface where users can interact with an AI assistant powered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. The application also features functionalities for creating and maintaining a journal, embedding journal entries for similarity searches, and managing user profiles.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Chat Interface**: Interact with a sophisticated chatbot powered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models.
- **Journaling**: Automatically generate journal entries from chatlogs and embed them for future reference and similarity searches.
- **User Profiles**: Maintain and update user profiles based on interactions with the chatbot.
- **Document Embedding**: Use OpenAI embeddings and FAISS vector storage for efficient similarity searches within journal entries.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.x
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 access)
- python-dotenv (for environment variable management)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project directory, and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Configuration

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is stored in the `.env` file.
- **Directory Structure**: The application expects specific directories for `Memories`, `Personas`, `Portrait`, and `system prompts`. Make sure these exist and are structured as per the application's requirements.

## Usage

- **Starting the Application**: Access the web interface by running the Streamlit command and navigating to the provided URL.
- **Interacting with the Chatbot**: Type your queries or messages in the chat input box and receive responses from the AI assistant.
- **Journaling and Profiles**: The application automatically updates journal entries and user profiles based on your interactions with the chatbot.
